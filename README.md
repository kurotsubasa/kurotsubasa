Always seeking personal growth, I expanded my coding acumen through a 500+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on Javascript, Ruby, React, and MongoDB.  am now eager to tackle more complex challenges and continue to find ways to build full stack applications to improve the quality of life for the world at large.
